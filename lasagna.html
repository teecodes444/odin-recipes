        <h2><stong>World's Best Lasagna Recipe</stong><em> (According to Your Mom's Best Friend's Cousin)</em></h2>

        <p>This lasagna recipe has been passed down through the generations, starting from 
            your mom's best friend's cousin who swore she got it from an Italian chef she 
            met on a cruise. This chef, who may or may not have been named Giuseppe, claimed 
            it was the secret recipe of his Nonna, who had to fend off marauding neighbors 
            with her rolling pin just to protect its sanctity.</p> 
            
        <p>Of course, Giuseppe had a flair for the dramatic, but who doesn't love a good 
            story with their lasagna? The legend states that whoever masters this recipe will 
            gain the ability to make any dinner guest swoon with delight and maybe even bring 
            about world peaceâ€”though that part is still under testing.</p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 box of lasagna noodles (the kind that don't require boiling because who has time for that?)</li>
            <li>2 jars of marinara sauce (because homemade sauce is for overachievers)</li>
            <li>1 pound of ground beef (or turkey if you're feeling fancy)</li>
            <li>1 pound of Italian sausage (spicy or mild, depending on how adventurous you are)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped (prepare for tears)</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced (because who doesn't love dragon breath?)</li>
            <li>2 tubs of ricotta cheese (full-fat because we're not quitters)</li>
            <li>2 eggs (to bind the cheese into a cheesy fortress)</li>
            <li>4 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese (yes, four cups. No ragrets.)</li>
            <li>1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese (for that extra cheesy oomph)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil and oregano (or dried if you forgot to go to the store)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>A sprinkle of love (mandatory)</li>
        </ul>
