        <h2><stong>World's Best Lasagna Recipe</stong><em> (According to Your Mom's Best Friend's Cousin)</em></h2>

        <p>This lasagna recipe has been passed down through the generations, starting from 
            your mom's best friend's cousin who swore she got it from an Italian chef she 
            met on a cruise. This chef, who may or may not have been named Giuseppe, claimed 
            it was the secret recipe of his Nonna, who had to fend off marauding neighbors 
            with her rolling pin just to protect its sanctity.</p> 
            
        <p>Of course, Giuseppe had a flair for the dramatic, but who doesn't love a good 
            story with their lasagna? The legend states that whoever masters this recipe will 
            gain the ability to make any dinner guest swoon with delight and maybe even bring 
            about world peace—though that part is still under testing.</p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 box of lasagna noodles (the kind that don't require boiling because who has time for that?)</li>
            <li>2 jars of marinara sauce (because homemade sauce is for overachievers)</li>
            <li>1 pound of ground beef (or turkey if you're feeling fancy)</li>
            <li>1 pound of Italian sausage (spicy or mild, depending on how adventurous you are)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, chopped (prepare for tears)</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced (because who doesn't love dragon breath?)</li>
            <li>2 tubs of ricotta cheese (full-fat because we're not quitters)</li>
            <li>2 eggs (to bind the cheese into a cheesy fortress)</li>
            <li>4 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese (yes, four cups. No ragrets.)</li>
            <li>1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese (for that extra cheesy oomph)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil and oregano (or dried if you forgot to go to the store)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>A sprinkle of love (mandatory)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (or whatever your oven feels like, honestly).</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, sauté the chopped onion until it looks translucent and you start questioning your life choices. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute because you deserve a flavorful life.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef and Italian sausage to the skillet. Cook until browned and try not to snack on it because you need it for the lasagna. Drain the fat because you don't need that kind of negativity in your life.</li>
            <li>Pour in the marinara sauce and let it simmer. Imagine you're in Italy while it bubbles away. Season with salt, pepper, basil, and oregano. Taste it, and if it needs more love, add another sprinkle.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, eggs, half of the Parmesan, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix until it looks like a cheesy cloud.</li>
            <li>Now, the fun part: layering! In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of sauce. Add a layer of noodles (uncooked if you're brave), then a layer of the ricotta mixture, and a generous handful of mozzarella. Repeat until you've run out of ingredients or patience, ending with a layer of sauce and a mountain of mozzarella and Parmesan on top.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with foil (but not too tightly, the cheese needs room to breathe). Bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes until the top is golden and bubbly and your kitchen smells like an Italian grandmother's hug.</li>
            <li>Let it cool for a few minutes because nobody enjoys a mouth burn. Serve with garlic bread, a salad (to pretend you're being healthy), and a glass of wine (because you deserve it).</li>
            <li>Bask in the glory of your creation and accept compliments graciously. Freeze the leftovers (if there are any) for future lazy dinners.</li>
            <li>Repeat as necessary, becoming a lasagna legend among your friends and family.</li>
        </ol>
