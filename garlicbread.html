        <h2><strong>The Easiest Garlic Bread Ever <em>(According to That One Guy at the Office Potluck)</em></strong></h2>

        <p>This garlic bread recipe has a storied past, beginning with that one guy at the office potluck who brought it in 
            and instantly became a hero. Legend has it, he discovered the recipe during a midnight snack session when he 
            accidentally dropped a stick of butter into a bowl of garlic. Instead of panicking, he embraced the chaos, 
            and thus, the world's easiest garlic bread was born.</p>

        <p>His coworkers dubbed him the “Bread Whisperer” and insisted he bring it to every gathering from then on. He even 
            claimed it was the reason he got promoted, but that part of the story is still up for debate. So, make this garlic 
            bread, and who knows? You might just find yourself becoming the office legend, too.</p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 loaf of French bread (or any bread you can find that looks vaguely French)</li>
            <li>1 stick of butter (softened, not melted; we're not making soup)</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic, minced (or more if you're warding off vampires)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for those feeling fancy)</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt (because butter isn't salty enough, right?)</li>
            <li>A sprinkle of Parmesan cheese (optional, but highly recommended for extra pizzazz)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (or 400°F if you're feeling rebellious).</li>
            <li>Slice the French bread in half lengthwise, like you're performing bread surgery. Place the halves on a baking sheet, cut side up.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the softened butter with the minced garlic, parsley, and a pinch of salt. Mash it together until it looks like a delicious, buttery garlic paste.</li>
            <li>Spread the garlic butter mixture generously over the cut sides of the bread. Don't be shy—this isn't the time to count calories.</li>
            <li>Optional: Sprinkle some Parmesan cheese on top for that extra cheesy kick. You know you want to.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden and crispy, and your kitchen smells like a garlic lover's paradise.</li>
            <li>Slice into pieces, serve warm, and prepare for everyone to ask for the recipe (and maybe your hand in marriage).</li>
            <li>Bask in the glory of your culinary prowess. You've earned it.</li>
        </ol>
