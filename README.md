# odin-recipes

Hi there! My name is Teecodes444 and welcome to my first completed project from The Odin Projects curriculum.

End Goal: Apply learnings from the HTML foundations course in the form of a Recipes site. This includes implementing elements and tags, ordered and unordered lists, relative links and images, HTML boilerplate, and getting comfortable with the commit, stage, push with Git/Github and the command line.
