        <h2><strong>The No-Fuss Caesar Salad <em>(Perfect for Lazy Gourmet Wannabes)</em></strong></h2>

        <p>This Caesar salad recipe was discovered in a moment of sheer desperation by a college student who realized 
            they had a dinner date in 15 minutes and nothing but lettuce, croutons, and a bottle of Caesar dressing in 
            the fridge. Legend has it, this student managed to whip up this salad while still in their pajamas, impressing 
            their date so much that they were immediately forgiven for the lack of other food. </p>

        <p>The salad became an instant classic, perfect for anyone who wants to look like they put in more effort than 
            they actually did. So, whip up this no-fuss Caesar salad and prepare to bask in the glory of minimal 
            effort and maximum flavor!</p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 head of romaine lettuce (or a bag of pre-chopped romaine if you're living in the future)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Caesar dressing (store-bought because who has time to make it from scratch?)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese (the more, the merrier)</li>
            <li>1 cup of croutons (because crunchy carbs are life)</li>
            <li>Optional: a squeeze of lemon juice (if you're feeling zesty)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>If you're using a head of romaine, chop it up into bite-sized pieces. If you're using pre-chopped romaine, give yourself a high-five for being efficient.</li>
            <li>Throw the lettuce into a large salad bowl. Not literally throw, but you get the idea.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the Caesar dressing over the lettuce. Eyeball it because measuring is for baking.</li>
            <li>Toss in the grated Parmesan cheese and croutons. Mix everything together with salad tongs or your (clean) hands if you're feeling rustic.</li>
            <li>Optional: Squeeze a bit of lemon juice over the salad for an extra kick. Pretend you're a chef on TV while doing it.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately and watch as everyone marvels at your culinary expertise.</li>
        </ol>
